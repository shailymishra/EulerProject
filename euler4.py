# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. 
# The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.


## Also in recurrsive function return the function, otherwise it will show none

## Have a palindrome function 889x11 = 9779 which then becomes largest  palindrome
## This logic failed - because 
## Find the max no i.e. 999x999
## Divide it by 111, and get the max number
## now keep decreasing that number, and multiply with 111 till we have a palindrome

## Logic 2  :: FAILED
## obviously for a palindrome it , one of the multiplicant will be 99,999, ...
## so just keep reducing it , and keep checking
## this also didnt work, because 999x91 = 90909, now there will be obviously better palindrome
